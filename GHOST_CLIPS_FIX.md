# Ghost Clips Bug - Fixed

## The Problem

"Ghost clips" appeared in the project - clips that:
- Don't show visually on the timeline
- Still exist in the project data
- Can be clicked (where they once were) and deleted
- Show in the clip count

## Root Cause

Clips became "ghosts" when their associated media file or track was deleted, but the clip itself wasn't removed from the project data.

**Example:**
1. User adds media file A → creates clip on track 1
2. User removes media file A → media file deleted, but clip remains in data
3. Timeline tries to render clip → media file not found → skips rendering
4. Result: Invisible clip that still exists in project state

## The Fix

Added automatic ghost clip detection and cleanup:

### 1. Detection
```typescript
const ghostClips = clips.filter(clip => {
  const hasMediaFile = mediaFiles.some(mf => mf.id === clip.mediaFileId);
  const hasTrack = tracks.some(t => t.id === clip.trackId);
  return !hasMediaFile || !hasTrack;
});
```

### 2. Auto-Cleanup
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (ghostClips.length > 0) {
    console.log(`🧹 Auto-cleaning ${ghostClips.length} ghost clips`);
    ghostClips.forEach(clip => {
      removeClip(clip.id);
    });
  }
}, [clips, mediaFiles, tracks, removeClip]);
```

### 3. Logging
Console warnings show which clips are ghosts and why:
```
Ghost clip detected: clip-123 (My Video) references missing media file mf-456
🧹 Auto-cleaning 2 ghost clips: [...]
Removing ghost clip: My Video (missing media file)
```

## How It Works

### On Every Render:
1. Checks each clip for valid media file reference
2. Checks each clip for valid track reference
3. If either is missing → marks as ghost clip
4. Automatically removes ghost clips from project data
5. Logs what was removed and why

### Prevention:
The projectManager already tries to cascade deletes:
- `removeMediaFile()` → also removes clips using that media file
- `removeTrack()` → also removes clips on that track

But this cleanup provides a safety net if anything slips through.

## User Impact

### Before:
- ❌ Ghost clips in project data
- ❌ Can't see them on timeline
- ❌ Confusing clip count
- ❌ Had to manually delete by clicking empty space

### After:
- ✅ Ghost clips automatically detected
- ✅ Automatically removed from project
- ✅ Accurate clip count
- ✅ Clean project data
- ✅ Console logs explain what was cleaned

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Add media file** → drag to timeline
2. **Check console** → should show clip count
3. **Remove media file** → should trigger cleanup
4. **Check console** → should see "Auto-cleaning ghost clips"
5. **Check timeline** → clip should be gone
6. **Check clip count** → should be accurate

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Media file removed** → clips using it are auto-removed  
✅ **Track deleted** → clips on it are auto-removed  
✅ **Both missing** → clip definitely removed  
✅ **Project loaded with ghosts** → cleaned on load  
✅ **Manual deletion still works** → if user clicks where ghost was  

## Technical Notes

### Why Ghosts Occurred:
The projectManager's cascade delete should work, but potential race conditions or state update timing could cause clips to remain. The auto-cleanup ensures no ghosts persist.

### Cleanup Timing:
Runs in useEffect after every render where clips, mediaFiles, or tracks change. This catches:
- File removals
- Track deletions
- Project loads
- State sync issues

### Performance:
- Only runs when dependencies change
- O(n*m) complexity: n clips × m media files/tracks
- Negligible for typical project sizes (< 100 clips)
- Cleanup only happens if ghosts detected

## Prevention Tips

The best approach is to ensure cleanup is handled at the source:
- ✅ `removeMediaFile` filters clips by `mediaFileId`
- ✅ `removeTrack` filters clips by `trackId`
- ✅ Auto-cleanup as safety net

Perfect data integrity! 🎬
