# Timeline Ruler Improvements

## Overview
The timeline ruler has been significantly enhanced with a professional three-tier visual hierarchy, improved time formatting, and better visual clarity. These improvements apply to both `AdvancedTimeline.tsx` and `VideoTimeline.tsx`.

## Summary of Latest Improvements (v3 - Current)

The timeline ruler now features **subtle, non-distracting markers** with improved typography for a clean, professional appearance.

### Refined Marker Design
- **Shorter Markers**: Major markers now only extend 50% of ruler height (down from full height)
- **Lighter Colors**: 
  - Major markers: 0.45 opacity (down from 0.9)
  - Sub-major markers: 0.30 opacity (down from 0.65)
  - Minor markers: 0.20 opacity (down from 0.40)
- **Thinner Lines**:
  - Major: 1.5px (down from 2.5px)
  - Sub-major: 1px (down from 1.5px)
  - Minor: 0.75px (down from 1px)
- **Lighter Shadows**: Reduced shadow intensity for subtle depth
- **Lighter Grid Lines**: 0.03 opacity (down from 0.06) for minimal distraction
- **New Hierarchy**:
  - Major: 50% ruler height
  - Sub-major: 35% ruler height
  - Minor: 20% ruler height

### Result
The markers are now **unobtrusive and elegant**, providing clear time reference without overwhelming the visual space. The text labels remain bold and readable while the tick marks blend subtly into the background.

## Summary of Previous Improvements (v2)

The timeline ruler was enhanced with **premium typography, modern styling, and refined visual design** for a professional, polished appearance.

### Typography Enhancements
- **Modern System Font Stack**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro', 'Segoe UI', 'Inter', 'Roboto'`
- **Semi-Bold Weight (600)**: Better readability and hierarchy
- **Larger Font Sizes**: 10-12px (adaptive based on zoom)
- **Gradient Text Fill**: Subtle gradient from pure white to slightly tinted for sophistication
- **Enhanced Shadow System**: Multi-layer shadows with blur for maximum readability
- **Accurate Text Spacing**: Uses `measureText()` for precise label positioning

### Marker Line Refinements
- **Rounded Line Caps**: Modern, softer appearance for major/sub-major markers
- **Canvas Shadow API**: Real shadows with blur for depth instead of manual layering
- **Highlight Lines**: Subtle left-side highlights for 3D effect
- **Cleaner Minor Markers**: Sharp ends (butt caps) for subtle appearance
- **Refined Grid Lines**: Better dash pattern (3px, 6px) with increased visibility

### Background & Borders
- **Richer Gradient**: Deeper, more premium glassmorphic background (0.50-0.65 opacity range)
- **Enhanced Highlights**: Brighter top shine with subtle bottom reflection
- **Prominent Bottom Border**: 2px border for clear separation
- **Stronger Shadow**: 6px gradient shadow below ruler for better depth perception
- **Improved Contrast**: Better visual separation from timeline tracks

## Key Improvements (v1)

### 1. Three-Tier Visual Hierarchy
The ruler now features a sophisticated three-level marker system:

- **Major Markers** (Full Height)
  - Span the entire ruler height
  - Display time labels
  - Thicker lines (2px) with glow effect
  - Optional grid lines extending into track area
  - Enhanced shadow for depth

- **Sub-Major Markers** (2/3 Height)
  - Medium height markers at half the major interval
  - Provides intermediate visual reference
  - 1.3px line width
  - Subtle shadow

- **Minor Markers** (1/3 Height)
  - Short ticks at the bottom of the ruler
  - 1px line width
  - Very subtle appearance
  - Provides fine-grained time reference

### 2. Enhanced Time Formatting
The `formatTime` function now supports multiple formats:

- **Frame Display**: Shows frame numbers when zoomed in very close
  - Format: `mm:ss:ff` (where ff = frame number)
  - Activates at high zoom levels (>200 pixels/second)
  - Uses 30 fps by default (configurable)

- **Milliseconds**: Shows centiseconds for medium zoom
  - Format: `mm:ss.cs` (where cs = centiseconds)
  - Better precision for editing

- **Hours Support**: Automatically displays hours for long videos
  - Format: `h:mm:ss` or `h:mm:ss.cs`

- **Adaptive Display**: Automatically chooses the best format based on:
  - Video duration
  - Zoom level
  - Time precision needed

### 3. Improved Visual Styling

#### Ruler Background
- Enhanced glassmorphic gradient with better contrast
- Stronger background opacity (0.55 â†’ 0.40)
- Top and bottom borders for clear definition
- Shadow below ruler for depth perception

#### Text Labels
- Multi-layer shadow system for maximum readability
  - Outer shadow (strongest): rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)
  - Middle shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)
  - Inner shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
  - Subtle highlight on top
- Near-white text (0.98 opacity) for maximum contrast
- Monospace font with better sizing (10-11px based on zoom)
- Better positioning (3px offset from markers)

#### Marker Lines
- Enhanced color hierarchy:
  - Major: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)
  - Sub-major: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.55)
  - Minor: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35)
- Glow effects on major markers
- Consistent shadow system for depth
- Proper line widths for each level

### 4. Grid Lines (AdvancedTimeline)
- Optional vertical grid lines extending from major markers
- Only visible when reasonably zoomed in (>20 pixels/second)
- Dashed lines (2px dash, 4px gap)
- Very subtle (0.04 opacity)
- Extends 300px into track area
- Helps with precise clip alignment

### 5. Better Border System
- Clear top border highlight (0.15 opacity)
- Stronger bottom border (0.25 opacity, 1.5px width)
- Shadow gradient below ruler (4px height)
- Creates clear visual separation from tracks

## Technical Details

### AdvancedTimeline.tsx
- Three-tier hierarchy with sub-major markers
- Frame-accurate display support
- Grid line extension into tracks
- Zoom-adaptive marker density
- Smart label spacing to prevent overlap
- Enhanced background gradient
- Professional border system

### VideoTimeline.tsx
- Simplified three-tier system (major + minor)
- 10 major markers with 5 minor ticks each
- Millisecond display for short videos (<60s)
- Hour support for long videos
- Enhanced marker styling matching AdvancedTimeline
- Ruler border for clarity

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: The three-tier hierarchy matches industry-standard video editing software
2. **Better Readability**: Enhanced text shadows and contrast work on any background
3. **Frame-Accurate Editing**: Frame display at high zoom enables precise frame-by-frame editing
4. **Improved Navigation**: Grid lines and clear visual hierarchy make timeline navigation easier
5. **Adaptive Precision**: Time format automatically adjusts to show appropriate detail level
6. **Visual Clarity**: Clear borders and shadows create proper depth and separation

## Usage

The improvements are automatic and require no code changes to use. The ruler will:
- Automatically show the appropriate level of detail based on zoom
- Display frames when zoomed in close enough
- Show milliseconds at medium zoom
- Display hours for long videos
- Adjust marker density to prevent overcrowding
- Apply grid lines when helpful for alignment

## Configuration Options

### Customizable Parameters
- Frame rate (currently 30 fps, can be made dynamic)
- Grid line visibility threshold
- Grid line extension distance
- Text spacing thresholds
- Marker height ratios
- Color schemes and opacities

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Dynamic frame rate detection from video metadata

- Customizable ruler colors/themes
- Snap-to-marker functionality
- Frame rate switching (23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 fps)
- SMPTE timecode display option
- Ruler height adjustment based on viewport size
