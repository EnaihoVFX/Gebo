# UI Improvements - Cleaner Preview Interface

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mode Toggle & Text
**Before:**
- Had "ðŸ“¦ Cached Mode (Recommended)" text
- Had toggle button between Streaming/Cached modes

**After:**
- Clean preview area with no mode indicators
- Always uses cached mode by default (works reliably)

### 2. Removed Instruction Guide
**Before:**
- When no clips, showed large numbered instruction list:
  1. Click "Add Media"...
  2. Drag media files...
  3. Preview will start...

**After:**
- Clean interface
- Video player always visible
- Minimal UI clutter

### 3. Black Screen on Empty Timeline
**NEW FEATURE:**
When the playhead is positioned over empty timeline space (no clips), the preview shows a plain black screen (16:9 aspect ratio), just like a regular video player with no content.

**How it works:**
- Tracks current playback time (30fps polling)
- Checks if any clip exists at that time position
- If no clip: Shows black screen overlay
- If clip exists: Shows normal video

**Benefits:**
- Visual feedback that you're between clips
- Professional editing behavior (like Premiere/DaVinci Resolve)
- Prevents confusion about why video isn't playing

## Technical Implementation

### Clip Detection Logic
```typescript
const hasClipAtCurrentTime = useMemo(() => {
  if (clips.length === 0) return false;
  
  return clips.some(clip => {
    const clipStart = clip.offset;
    const clipEnd = clip.offset + (clip.endTime - clip.startTime);
    return currentPlaybackTime >= clipStart && currentPlaybackTime < clipEnd;
  });
}, [clips, currentPlaybackTime]);
```

### Black Screen Overlay
```typescript
{!hasClipAtCurrentTime && clips.length > 0 && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black pointer-events-none rounded" 
       style={{ aspectRatio: "16 / 9" }} />
)}
```

### Real-time Updates
- Updates during playback (30fps)
- Updates during scrubbing (immediate via `seekVideo`)
- Works in both play and pause states

## User Experience

### Before
- Confusing when playhead was between clips (showed last frame or black)
- Instructions took up space
- Mode toggle was technical jargon

### After
- Clean, professional interface
- Clear feedback when between clips
- Focus on the content, not the controls

## What You'll See Now

1. **Clean preview area** - No mode labels or instructions
2. **During playback** - When playhead enters empty space, shows plain black screen (16:9)
3. **When scrubbing** - Immediate black screen when dragging over empty areas
4. **Between clips** - Clean black screen, just like professional video editors
5. **On clips** - Normal video playback

Perfect for a clean editing workflow! ðŸŽ¬
